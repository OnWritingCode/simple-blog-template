# Blank Slate

This is a blank slate project for starting a blog with Astro.js.


## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public
└── src
    ├── components
    │   ├── layouts
    │   └── utilities
    ├── content
    ├── pages
    └── style
```

 * *pages* - This directory is significant for Astro. Files here become URLs.
 * *components* - Template parts, layouts, utilities, all go here.
 * *content* - Keep the content separate from the system for clearer separation. 
 * *style* - Global SCSS styles.
 * *public* - A directory where to place any static files that need to be used on the site.


## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
